# Overview

This is a data analysis project that I created to explore statistics from the 2022 FIFA World Cup. I created my program in Visual Studio Code in a Jupyter notebook. It is written in python. The purpose of this program is to use the statistics from the games played in the World Cup to answer questions about the World Cup.

You can find the data that I used for this analysis here: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/die9origephit/fifa-world-cup-2022-complete-dataset?resource=download)

# Data Analysis Results

1. How does defensive performance affect offensive productivity?
* There is not a strong enough trend to say for certain whether or not better defensive statistics affect the number of offensive chances created.
* There was a slight coorelation that suggested better defense produced less offensive chances.
* Spain was the most effective team at converting defensive stops to offensive chances.

2. Which group was the hardest to escape?
* I found that Group E had was the best statistically. They had both the highest defensive and offensive statistics in the tournament.
* Groups A and F were to two worst statistical groups in the tournamnet. Having some of the lowest offensive and defensive statistics.

# Future Work
